## Introduction

Java is one of the most popular programming languages, especially in enterprise environments. This repository contains solutions to a variety of interview questions that range from fundamental concepts to advanced topics.

## Questions and Solutions

The questions are categorized based on topics such as:

- Strings
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Multithreading
- Design Patterns
- Others

Each directory contains a problem and its solution in Java. Every question is its own java maven project, with a class Solution, where the solution is implemented in a static method. 
This method is called in the Main class, with a sample nominal test case to show it works. Further tests can be found in src/main/test where we have different edge cases being tested.
